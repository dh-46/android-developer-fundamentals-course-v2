# Homework: 4.2: Input controls

## Question 1

What's the most important difference between checkboxes and a `RadioGroup` of radio buttons? Choose one:

1. The only difference is in how they appear: checkboxes show a checkmark when selected, while circular "radio" buttons appear filled when selected.
2. `CheckBox` elements in the layout can use the `android:onClick` attribute to call a handler when selected.
3. **The major difference is that checkboxes enable multiple selections, while a `RadioGroup` allows only one selection.**

## Question 2

Which layout group lets you align a set of `CheckBox` elements vertically? Choose one:

1. `RelativeLayout`
2. **`LinearLayout`**
3. `ScrollView`

## Question 3

Which of the following is the method of the `Checkable` interface to check the state of a radio button (that is, whether it has been selected or not)?

1. `getId()`
2. **`isChecked()`**
3. `onRadioButtonClicked()`
4. `onClick()`
