# Homework: 3.1: The debugger

## Question 1

3. The app may be doing too much work on its main thread.
4. The code cache capacity was increased to 128KB.

Which function do you perform in the Debug pane in order to execute the current line where the breakpoint is, and then stop at the next line in the code? Choose one:

1. Step Into
2. **Step Over**
3. Step Out
4. Resume

## Question 3

Which function do you perform in the Debug pane in order to jump to the execution of a method call from the current line where the breakpoint is? Choose one:
